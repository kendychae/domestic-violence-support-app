## Learning Strategies Used

### 1. **Official Documentation**

I started by reading the official documentation for the technologies I used:

- **React Native Documentation** - Learned about components, navigation, and styling
- **React Navigation Docs** - Understood how to implement stack navigation
- **AsyncStorage Documentation** - Learned about local data storage on mobile devices

**Why this worked:** Official docs are authoritative and provide accurate, up-to-date information about the technologies.

---

### 2. **Video Tutorials**

I watched several YouTube tutorials to understand React Native basics:

- "React Native Tutorial for Beginners"
- "React Navigation Complete Guide"
- "AsyncStorage in React Native"

**Why this worked:** Videos show the development process in action, making it easier to understand how pieces fit together. Seeing someone code along helped me understand the workflow.

---

### 3. **Hands-On Practice**

I learned by doing - I built the app incrementally:

1. First got navigation working with one screen
2. Then added more screens one at a time
3. Added storage functionality after screens were working
4. Tested each feature as I built it

**Why this worked:** Writing code myself (rather than just reading) helped cement my understanding. Breaking the project into small steps prevented overwhelm.

---

### 4. **AI Assistance (GitHub Copilot)**

I used AI to help with:

- Suggesting component structure
- Providing styling examples
- Debugging error messages
- Understanding async/await syntax

**Why this worked:** AI provided quick answers to specific questions and helped me understand patterns in React Native code. It was like having a tutor available 24/7.

---

### 5. **Stack Overflow & Community Forums**

When I encountered errors, I searched:

- Stack Overflow for specific error messages
- React Native community forums
- GitHub issues for similar problems

**Why this worked:** Others have encountered similar problems, so searching for error messages often led directly to solutions.

---

### 6. **Trial and Error**

When documentation wasn't clear, I experimented:

- Tried different approaches to see what worked
- Modified example code to understand how it behaved
- Made intentional mistakes to understand error messages

**Why this worked:** Sometimes the best way to learn is to break things and fix them. This deepened my understanding of how React Native works.

---

## What Worked Best

The **combination of official docs + video tutorials + hands-on practice** was most effective:

1. Read docs to understand concepts
2. Watch videos to see practical implementation
3. Code it myself to internalize the knowledge

Having AI assistance was incredibly helpful for quick questions and debugging.

## What Was Challenging

### Challenge 1: Understanding Async/Await
- **Problem:** Struggled with asynchronous JavaScript for storage functions
- **Solution:** Watched specific tutorial on async/await, practiced with simple examples first
- **Lesson:** Sometimes need to step back and learn foundational concepts before moving forward

### Challenge 2: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- **Problem:** Didn't understand when/why to use hooks
- **Solution:** Read React documentation, experimented with different use cases
- **Lesson:** Understanding core React concepts is essential for React Native

### Challenge 3: Navigation Between Screens
- **Problem:** Confused about how navigation.navigate() worked
- **Solution:** Drew diagrams of screen flow, studied navigation docs carefully
- **Lesson:** Visual aids help understand abstract concepts like navigation stacks

---

## Skills Developed

Through this project, I learned:

1. **React Native Basics** - Components, JSX, styling
2. **State Management** - useState hook for form inputs and data
3. **Navigation** - Stack navigation and passing data between screens
4. **Async Storage** - Persisting data locally on the device
5. **API Integration** - Using device features (phone, SMS, browser)
6. **Debugging** - Reading error messages and troubleshooting issues

---

## How I Would Approach Future Projects

Based on this experience, for my next mobile app I would:

1. **Start with a clear plan** - Sketch screens and features before coding
2. **Build incrementally** - Get one feature working before adding another
3. **Test frequently** - Run the app after every major change
4. **Document as I go** - Add comments while code is fresh in my mind
5. **Use version control** - Commit working code regularly (would use Git from the start)

---

## Resources That Were Most Helpful

### Top Resources:
1. **React Native Documentation** - https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started
2. **React Navigation** - https://reactnavigation.org/
3. **Programming with Mosh (YouTube)** - Clear, beginner-friendly tutorials
4. **Net Ninja (YouTube)** - Great React Native series
5. **GitHub Copilot** - Real-time coding assistance

---

## Time Management Strategies

How I managed my time effectively:

- **Broke project into smaller tasks** - Easier to make progress in short sessions
- **Set daily goals** - "Today I'll complete the Helpline screen"
- **Worked in focused blocks** - 1-2 hour sessions with breaks
- **Left comments for myself** - Helped me remember where I left off

---

## Reflection

### What I'm Proud Of:
- Created a fully functional app with real-world usefulness
- Learned an entirely new technology (React Native) from scratch
- Implemented data persistence successfully
- Created comprehensive documentation

### What I'd Do Differently:
- Start with a more detailed plan/wireframe
- Set up GitHub from day one instead of at the end
- Learn more about React basics before diving into React Native
- Test on physical device earlier (not just emulator)

---

## Conclusion

This project taught me that mobile development is achievable even for beginners when you:
1. Break the problem into small pieces
2. Use multiple learning resources
3. Practice hands-on coding
4. Don't give up when stuck - search for solutions!

The most important lesson: **Learning how to learn** is more valuable than memorizing syntax. When I got stuck, I knew how to find answers through documentation, tutorials, forums, and experimentation.

**Note:** This reflection demonstrates my learning process and strategies for this module. Future projects will benefit from lessons learned here.
