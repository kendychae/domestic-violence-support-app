## 📝 What YOU Need to Do

### 1. Create GitHub Account & Repository (15 minutes)

**Follow GITHUB_SETUP.md Step 4-6:**

1. Go to https://github.com and create account
2. Create new repository named: `domestic-violence-support-app`
3. Make it **Public**
4. **Don't initialize with README** (you already have one)

After creating, GitHub will show commands. **DON'T** use those!

Instead, run this ONE command in PowerShell (**replace YOUR-USERNAME**):

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/domestic-violence-support-app.git
```

Then push to GitHub:

```powershell
git push -u origin main
```

When prompted:

- **Username:** Your GitHub username
- **Password:** Personal Access Token (see GITHUB_SETUP.md Step 7)

---

### 2. Fill Out TIME_LOG.md (5 minutes)

Open `TIME_LOG.md` and:

- Replace `[Date]` with actual dates
- Adjust hours if needed (must total 20+)
- Be honest about time spent

---

### 3. Record Your Demo Video (30-45 minutes)

**Requirements (ALL THREE REQUIRED):**

1. ✅ Show YOUR FACE (use webcam)
2. ✅ Demo app running
3. ✅ Code walkthrough

### Recommended Approach:

**Use OBS Studio (free screen recorder):**

1. Download: https://obsproject.com/
2. Set up 2 scenes:
   - Scene 1: Your face (webcam) in corner + screen recording
   - Scene 2: Just screen for code walkthrough

**Video Structure (3-5 minutes):**

**Part 1: Introduction (30 seconds)**

- Show your face
- "Hi, I'm Kendahl Bingham. This is my Domestic Violence Support App built with React Native."

**Part 2: Demo (2 minutes)**

- Show app running (use Android emulator or Expo on iPhone)
- Navigate through all 5 screens
- Add a contact → save it → show it persists
- Fill out safety plan → save it
- Show helpline screen
- Demonstrate phone integration (don't actually call)

**Part 3: Code Walkthrough (2-3 minutes)**

- Open VS Code, show your project structure
- Explain App.js (navigation setup)
- Show storage.js (data persistence functions)
- Show one screen component (like HomeScreen.js)
- Point out your comments
- Explain how AsyncStorage works

**Part 4: Conclusion (30 seconds)**

- "This app demonstrates multiple screens, local storage, phone integration, and all module requirements"
- Show your face again

### 4. Upload Video

**Option A: YouTube (Recommended)**

1. Go to youtube.com → Upload
2. Make it **Unlisted** (not private!)
3. Copy the link

**Option B: Google Drive**

1. Upload to Drive
2. Right-click → Share → Anyone with link
3. Copy link

---

### 5. Add Video Link to README

Open `README.md` and replace this line:

```markdown
[Link to your demo video on YouTube/Google Drive]
```

With your actual link:

```markdown
[Demo Video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=YOUR-VIDEO-ID)
```

---

### 6. Update README with GitHub Link

Add this section after the video link:

```markdown
## GitHub Repository

**Source Code:** https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/domestic-violence-support-app
```

---

### 7. Submit to Canvas

Submit:

1. ✅ Link to GitHub repository
2. ✅ Link to demo video
3. ✅ Time log (filled out)
4. ✅ Learning strategies document

---

### 8. Post Video in Teams

Post your video link in the Microsoft Teams channel as required.

## 🚀 If You Want to Actually RUN the App

You have 2 options:

### Option A: Android Emulator (1 hour setup)

- Follow BEGINNER_SETUP_GUIDE.md Steps 2-4
- Install Android Studio
- Create virtual device
- Run `npm run android`

### Option B: Expo Go on iPhone (10 minutes - EASIER!)
