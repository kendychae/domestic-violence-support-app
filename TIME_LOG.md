## Key Milestones Achieved

- ✅ React Native project setup with navigation
- ✅ 5 fully functional screens (Home, Helpline, Contacts, Safety Plan, Resources)
- ✅ Local data persistence with AsyncStorage
- ✅ Phone integration (calling/texting)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and comments
- ✅ Demo video recorded

---

## Challenges & Time Spent Troubleshooting

1. **AsyncStorage Setup** (30 min) - Initially struggled with async/await syntax
2. **Navigation Configuration** (45 min) - Took time to understand Stack Navigator structure
3. **Phone Linking** (20 min) - Needed to research correct URL schemes for tel: and sms:
4. **State Management** (40 min) - Learning useState and useEffect hooks for form handling

---

## Notes

- Most time was spent on learning React Native fundamentals
- Data persistence with AsyncStorage was easier than expected
- UI design and styling took less time than anticipated
- Testing on device/emulator was straightforward once setup was complete
